### Who am I? 

Young and ambitious programmer from Poland. I am interested in machine learning and embedded systems. Privately addicted to watching movies and reading books. Currently studying Aerospace Design which is my other passion.

## My education 
I got my Master of Science (Polish: magister) at Wroc≈Çaw University of Science and Technology.

During studies I had courses which included the following topics:
- Deep learning - theoretical background of different network types (LSTM, RNN, CNN, Capsule Networks, attention), practical training with Tensorflow with CNNs (image classification) and LSTMs (sentiment classification), also ensembling of neural networks
- Natural Language Processing (NLP) -  part-of-speech tagging (MorphoDiTa), word embeddings (Word2Vec, FastText), topic modeling (LDA, BigARTM)
- Probabilistic Modeling - implementation of basic probabilistic models in Pyro.ai
- Computer Vision - non-neural algorithms like Canny edge detector, done small project in recognizing geometric shapes with OpenCV
- Social media analysis (Twitter and Reddit, also comments under local newspapers articles, scraping with Scrapy)
- Large Scale Data Processing - building data processing pipeline with Docker, Kubernetes, Celery, MongoDB, AWS and PySpark
- Basics of machine learning - algorithms like NaiveBayes, SVM, decision trees and clustering

Example projects I made during my studies (all links in Polish):
- [Efekt korony](https://efekt-korony.github.io)  - analysis of influence of coronavirus pandemics on crime rate, social media, newspapers, and public transport in Poland. All interactive visualizations were made in Altair.
- [G≈Ços danych](https://smapwr.github.io/posters/2019_2020/pdf/glos_danych.pdf) - scraping articles and comments from a network of local newspaper in different regions of Poland, connected with topic modeling and sentiment classification
- [Sieci neuronowe dla Lotnictwa i Kosmonautyki](https://github.com/chalggg/sieci-neuronowe-lik) - very simple introductory presentation about neural networks with code example in Jupyter Notebook. I presented it to give my fellow student a good starting point for training their own NNs

My Bachelor studies taught me about:
- algorithmics (including analysis of computational complexity)
- web design
- architecture of computers and operating systems (including basics of ARM and x86 assembly)
- mathematical background (topology, graph theory, complex calculus)
- databases (SQL, normal forms)

## Programming languages I speak:
- Python - used for data analysis and neural network training, but also as a way to control embedded devices through serial port and scrap websites. Useful libraries I use: Pandas, Numpy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Altair (visualization), Tensorflow, JupyterNotebook, Pyserial,
- C/C++: programming embedded devices (mostly Arduino, but recently also STM32), also some experience with Linux system programming. Mostly using pure C, but recently reading and experimenting more with C++.
- Java - my main language during Bachelor studies, recently a little bit forgotten
- Javascript/HTML/CSS - I can design, program and style simple websites. I have some experience using Chrome's DevTools. During my cooperation with students research circle KN Pirm at my university I setup a Node.js server which streamed realtime video to users and showed electric motorcycle's position on a map.
- SQL - ability to write basic queries



During my studies I tried numerous different programming languages like: Prolog, Erlang, VHDL and Oz but I can't say I know them very well.
