### Who am I? 

Young and ambitious programmer from Poland. I am interested in machine learning and embedded systems. Privately addicted to watching movies and reading books. Currently studying Aerospace Design which is my other passion.

## My education 
I got my Master of Science (Polish: magister) at Wroc≈Çaw University of Science and Technology.

During studies I had courses which included the following topics:
- Deep learning: theoretical background of different network types (LSTM, RNN, CNN, Capsule Networks, attention), practical training with Tensorflow with CNNs (image classification) and LSTMs (sentiment classification), also ensembling of neural networks
- Natural Language Processing (NLP):  part-of-speech tagging (MorphoDiTa), word embeddings (Word2Vec, FastText), topic modeling (LDA, BigARTM)
- Probabilistic Modeling: implementation of basic probabilistic models in Pyro.ai
- Computer Vision: non neural algorithms like Canny edge detector and FFT
- Social Media Analysis (Twitter and Reddit, also comments under local newspapers articles)

<!-- My Bachelor studies included the following topics:
- algoritmics (including analysis of computational complexity)
- web design
- architecture of computers
